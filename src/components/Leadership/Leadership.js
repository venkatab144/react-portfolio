                    <p>Throughout my academic and professional career I've been involved in various projects that have required me to step up and assume a leadership role. I have academic experience as a web development lead, Android development lead, engineering project manager and software architect lead. Professionally, I have been involved in mentoring and assisting interns and new developers on our team as well as being the leader/expert of several sub-systems within our team.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Academically, I have led the development of software projects in some of my Studio classes, this includes leading my team for web development projects which required me to pick a full stack system to build our website with, organisation of team members, as well as delegation and monitoring of tasks. I also was the team lead for several different android applications we had to develop, I was responsible for organising the team and deciding what languages, frameworks, version control and platforms we would use. I have also been the lead software architect for an Olympics rowing scheduling and tracking system which required knowledge regarding various different technologies and frameworks and their synergy together.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Professionally, I have been the lead for several sub-projects our team had surrounding our Commission calculation system. This required me to create detailed techincal design builds of all aspects of the project so that it could be implemented most efficiently. I have also been involved with mentoring and helping interns at our company who are just entering the world of professional software development. I answer all questions directed towards me and assist with any tasks that they are finding difficult. </p>

Coral imagery data is collected from various different sources, labelled and compiled â€“ pre-labelled datasets can also be used. This data will then be used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify the species of coral. Coral health imagery data will also be collected. This health data will be used to train the CNN to automatically classify coral health. This project will be built using python, tensorflow and keras."
